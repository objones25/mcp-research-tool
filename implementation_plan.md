# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Research Orchestration

## 1. Component Updates Overview

### A. Rename and Restructure queryEnhancer
- Rename to `queryOptimizer.ts` to better reflect its purpose
- Retain URL extraction functionality from current implementation
- Add new optimization capabilities specifically for research tools

### B. Enhance orchestrateResearch Function
- Transform linear flow into iterative approach
- Add assessment and gap analysis components
- Implement proper termination conditions
- Maintain parallelization where beneficial

## 2. queryOptimizer.ts Component

### Purpose
Transform from basic metadata extraction to a more useful query optimization system that tailors queries for each specific research tool.

### Key Functions
1. **extractBasicMetadata(query)**
   - Extract URLs, YouTube links, and other basic query features
   - Serves as a preprocessing step

2. **analyzeQuery(query, env)**
   - Currently exists, will be simplified
   - Focus on core metadata needed for tool selection

3. **optimizeQueriesForTools(query, analysis, tools, env, previousFindings)**
   - NEW: Core optimization function
   - Uses LLM to generate optimized parameters for each tool
   - Accounts for each tool's requirements and capabilities
   - Returns object mapping tool IDs to optimized parameters

## 3. Enhanced orchestrateResearch Function

### Iterative Process Flow
1. Initial query analysis
2. Tool selection
3. Query optimization for selected tools
4. Parallel tool execution
5. Relevance assessment
6. Storage of relevant findings
7. Gap analysis
8. Decision to continue or terminate
9. Final synthesis of all relevant findings

### New Helper Functions

1. **assessRelevance(originalQuery, results, env)**
   - Evaluates relevance of results to original query
   - Filters out irrelevant or outdated information
   - Returns categorized results with confidence scores

2. **analyzeGaps(query, allRelevantResults, env)**
   - Identifies information gaps in current findings
   - Determines if additional iterations would be valuable
   - Returns prioritized list of follow-up questions or empty array

3. **summarizeCurrentKnowledge(relevantResults)**
   - Creates a digestible summary of what has been learned so far
   - Used for gap analysis and final synthesis

## 4. Termination Conditions

Implement a multi-faceted approach to prevent unnecessary iterations:
- Maximum iterations (controlled by depth parameter)
- No significant information gaps identified
- High confidence threshold reached (e.g., 0.8+)
- Diminishing returns detected between iterations
- All relevant tools exhausted

## 5. Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundational Changes
1. Create basic iterative structure in orchestrateResearch
2. Build queryOptimizer transformation
3. Implement initial termination conditions

### Phase 2: Advanced Capabilities
1. Implement relevance assessment
2. Add gap analysis functionality
3. Refine termination conditions

### Phase 3: Optimization & Testing
1. Test with varied query types
2. Optimize LLM prompt engineering
3. Adjust weights and thresholds based on results

## 6. Error Handling and Fallbacks

- Implement graceful fallbacks at each step
- Ensure iteration can proceed even if one component fails
- Default to simple approach if complex analysis fails
- Log detailed diagnostics for future improvements

## 7. Performance Considerations

- Cache intermediate results where appropriate
- Optimize parallel execution patterns
- Consider batching similar LLM requests
- Monitor execution time per iteration for optimization

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the orchestrator while keeping changes focused and manageable. Each component has a clear purpose and the overall flow maintains the original system's strengths while adding powerful new capabilities.
